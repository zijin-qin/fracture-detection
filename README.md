## Checking for missing data
As part of our data exploration process, we assessed the completeness of the data set. We compared the number of image files to the number of label files, which we found to match. We also examined the image and label file names, which we found to be consistent. We noticed that the label files do not all contain the same amount of information, but each file follows a consistent format of five values per line.
